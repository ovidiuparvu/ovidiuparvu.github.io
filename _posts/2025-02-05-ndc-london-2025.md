I have attended the NDC London 2025 conference and it was a wonderful experience. If you have not attended an NDC conference before, based on my experience from 2025, I would wholeheartedly recommend that you do. NDC conferences are organised in several [countries](https://www.ndcconferences.com), so you do not need to wait for the next conference in London to attend.

The ingredients that made my conference experience so enjoyable this year are:
1. A very useful 2 day practical workshop on [messaging](https://ndclondon.com/workshops/practical-messaging-workshop/377bfb56107c).
2. Insightful [talks](https://ndclondon.com/agenda) with lots of demos for the next 3 days.
3. An awesome community which is welcoming to newcomers (like me).
4. Exciting companies to engage with at their booths.
5. An ad-hoc .NET London Meetup event during one of the evenings.

# Overview of topics covered

I have attended a workshop and several talks covering the following topics:
1. Artificial intelligence.
2. Messaging in distributed systems.
3. Software architecture.
4. C# and .NET.

Given that several workshops and talks were running concurrently most of the time the topics listed above are only a small subset of the topics covered by the conference.

I will summarize below my main takeaways for each topic.

# Artificial intelligence talks

- The building blocks that I think can be integrated to build great AI applications are:
1. Local large language models (LLMs).
2. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
3. Predict + function call loops.
4. Voice instead of text input.
5. AI powered tools.

Over the next few weeks I will create sample demos using the building blocks listed above, so periodically come back to my blog if you are interested.

## AI powered tools

### VS Code

Useful features available in VS Code include:
- Ability to use per-project custom Copilot instructions.
- Button to automatically generate commit message.
- Copilot in the terminal.
- Ability to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for code generation.
- "Edit with Copilot" for large scale code generation.
- Copilot commands: /tests, /fix, /explain

# Messaging in distributed systems talks and workshop

- In order to build large-scale distributed systems that are maintainable and evolvable over time the systems typically need to be split up into multiple components.
- These components usually need to interact and ideally they would be as loosely coupled as possible.
    - Decoupling allows teams to work independently and an organisation to scale.
- Messaging can be used to allow components to be as loosely coupled as possible and to interact in a reliable manner.
- Queuing theory (from mathematics) can be used to do capacity planning.
- As long as components need to interact they need to be coupled to a certain extent.
    - Data coupling allows components to be loosely coupled.
    - Why switch from sync (e.g. HTTP) to async interactions between components? Resilience.
- There are design patterns for how to add messaging code to applications.
- Message pump = forever loop that reads message off channel + translate to other representation + dispatch.
- Break large messages into pieces (e.g 64-256KB).
- To send large messages use claim checks (i.e. store content in distributed storage => token, send token to receivers, receiver uses token to retrieve content from distributed storage).
- Messaging (has intent, uses commands) vs eventing (provides facts, events, notifications).
- Popular message queuing solution: Rabbit MQ.
- Popular streaming solution: Kafka.
- Popular C# frameworks: Brighter, MassTransit, InServiceBus
- Scaling out:
    - Message queues: Increase # of consumers.
    - Streams: Partition # of streams.
- [Postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle): Enforce schemas on producer, be flexible on the consumer side
    - Forward transitive schema compatibility is typically used
- Patterns for reliably performing writes in one transactional DB and another data store:
    1. Outbox model;
    2. Outbox and inbox model;
    3. Tailing DB log and writing to outbox using a sweeper.
    4. State change capture.
- Standards:
    - AsyncAPI: like OpenAPI for messaging.
    - CloudEvents: for defining headers.
    - OTEL: Observability.
- Messaging patterns (involving requestor vs provider):
    - In-Only: Provider is a consumer.
    - Out-Only: Provider is a producer.
    - In-Out: Both provider and requestor are consumers and producers.
- Typically messaging is used for In-Only patterns and eventing is used for Out-Only patterns.
- Red Panda Connect can be used to convert DB/stream/queue into stream/queue.
- Miro can be used to design interactions between services.

# Software architecture talks

## Software architects

- "Architects aren't the smartest people in the room. They make everyone else smarter."
- What makes architects valuable to a business:
1. Connect the different levels in an organisation.
2. Use metaphors to help people understand concepts using their own language.
3.
