If contents are hard to read in Beyond Compare on Linux when using a dark system theme because the colours get in the way (e.g. white text on light gray background) then try the fixes from [this](https://forum.scootersoftware.com/forum/beyond-compare-4-discussion/linux-aa/83063-linux-darkmode-system-color-setting-leaves-bcompare-unusable) forum thread.

The approach form the linked forum thread that worked for me is [this](https://forum.scootersoftware.com/forum/beyond-compare-4-discussion/linux-aa/83063-linux-darkmode-system-color-setting-leaves-bcompare-unusable?p=89301#post89301).
