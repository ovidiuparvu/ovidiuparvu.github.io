Answer:

Generating a table of contents (TOC) for a Markdown file can be accomplished in several waysâ€”ranging from using command-line tools and editor extensions to writing your own script. Below are several methods, along with step-by-step instructions and insights into each approach.

...

## 2. Using Editor Extensions

### Visual Studio Code and Markdown All in One  
If you use VS Code, the [Markdown All in One extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) makes generating a TOC easy:

- **Installation:**  
  Install the extension from the VS Code marketplace.
  
- **Usage:**  
  Open your Markdown file and open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`), then type and select **"Markdown All in One: Create Table of Contents"**. The extension inserts a TOC at your cursor or replaces an existing one.

...
```

Option 2, namely the VSCode extension, worked great for me.
