Coding use cases for which I have successfully used LLMs in the past include:

1. Code review of the git diff between a feature branch and the parent branch before raising a PR.
2. Reformatting and prettifying (e.g. using emojis) a block of text to be saved in an .md file.
3. Translation of English language queries to SQL queries having given the SQL schema and a description thereof as context.
4. Creating a coding agent that has access to user-defined functions passed in as tools. 
5. Interactive chats about how to do XYZ.
6. Code completions.
